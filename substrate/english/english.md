I will start my day by updating the system packages on my Ubuntu 24 LTS machine.

I need to review the architecture documentation for the new list rendering module.

I am going to implement a basic API endpoint using Node.js and Express.

I will refactor the data fetching logic to improve the Abstraction layer of our project.

I plan to apply Decomposition by breaking down the main list component into smaller, reusable sub-components.

I will research the most efficient Algorithms for handling large datasets in the browser.

I have a meeting scheduled to discuss the software architecture with the senior lead.

I am going to write unit tests to ensure the list rendering works correctly under heavy load.

I will optimize the Node.js event loop performance for better server-side rendering.

I will finish the day by cleaning up the backlog and prioritizing tasks for tomorrow.
